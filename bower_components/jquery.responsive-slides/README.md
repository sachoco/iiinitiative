# ResponsiveSlides.js v1.54

This is a fork of http://responsiveslides.com that provides better bower support and a different file naming.
You can use it with tools like [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep). Created a new fork since since the main repos has being unactive for 2 years now.
